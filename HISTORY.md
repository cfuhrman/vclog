# RELEASE HISTORY

## 1.2 / 2009-10-26

Version 1.2 overhuals the internals so that History
output is based on scm tags, not on a pre-existing history file.
This is really the proper way to go about it and those
who use it will, I think, be happily surprised at how it
promotes good practices for the maintenance of History files.
This overhaul led to substantial changes in the command-line
interface.
