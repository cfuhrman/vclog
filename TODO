== Support Markdown and RDoc release output styles

Right now its all RDoc.

== Imporved parsing flexability

In general parsing hueristics need to be imporved. Some specifics:

* Need to support relase comments.
* Need to recognize "Changes:" marker


== Typed option needs work

It produced no results sometimes. Fix or deprecate.


== Automagical Version

Would be cool if it could also generate an automagical version number.

=== For Git

We started off by looking at what git can tell us about the current release:

    * git-rev-parse <id> tells up what the ID of the <id> is, we can find out the current commit's ID by using HEAD (or nothing at all)
    * git-rev-list <id>..HEAD tells us what the commits were between the <id> and the current commit
    * git-describe <id> shows us, in a nice format, a unique description of the commit.

Using all of this together Patrick came up with:

    BRANCH=`git-describe | awk -F'-g[0-9a-fA-F]+' '{print $1}'`
    COMMIT=`git-rev-parse HEAD | awk '{print substr($1,0,8)}'`
    INCREMENT=`git-rev-list $BRANCH..HEAD | wc -l | awk '{print $1}'` 
    TGZ="openswan-$BRANCH-($INCREMENT)-g$COMMIT.tgz"

What this attempts to achieve is create a tar ball name that describes the release using the last tag, the number of builds since the tag was made, and the short commit ID. Here is the breakdown of the bits:

    * BRANCH will tell us what major release this is a part of,
    * INCREMENT is a pseudo build number (it's really the number of commits since the last release), and
    * g*COMMIT* is the short ID of the commit that generated the build.
